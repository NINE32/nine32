With so many locally-hosted services needed for my work, I was struggling to remember all of the URLs, not to mention the loss in productivity of typing the URLs several times a day, so I created a simple page to contain links to all of the services. After showing it to a colleague, the knowledge of its existance got out and the page was copied and used for similar collections of links across a further four companies.
