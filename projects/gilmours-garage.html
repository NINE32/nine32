Embark on a journey through time with Gilmour's Garage, a haven of automotive craftsmanship nestled in the heart of California, USA. For decades, Ken Gilmour has been the driving force behind this iconic establishment, breathing new life into a myriad of vintage vehicles through his passion and expertise.<br />
<br />
Ken approached me with a simple request â€“ to create a graphic that would adorn the side of his personal shop truck, paying homage to the timeless charm of the vehicles he specializes in. Drawing inspiration from the golden age of automobiles, we set out to capture the essence of nostalgia and craftsmanship in every brushstroke<br />
<br />
With meticulous attention to detail, we crafted a design that seamlessly blends vintage aesthetics with contemporary flair, embodying the spirit of Gilmour's Garage. As the graphic adorns Ken's trusty truck, it serves as a symbol of his unwavering dedication to preserving the legacy of classic cars and trucks.<br />
