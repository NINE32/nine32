Originally, this was a website design for a local technology conference. After the conference date passed, I changed the branding and text to represent a fictional technology conference in order to be able to display the website design on my portfolio.<br />
<br/>
The idea of the site was to draw in exhibitors and sponsors, and visitors a place to view information about the conference.
