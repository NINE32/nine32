<em>Peak Storage</em> represents a collaborative endeavor between myself and a colleague, dedicated to providing cost-effective, immutable backup and storage solutions to our clientele.<br />
<br />
Equipped with an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) hosting platform and a robust storage array, we embarked on the development of a product to present to our management team. To ensure our pitch commanded attention, I spearheaded the creation of a distinct name, logo, and website.<br />
<br />
The website is to be uploaded shortly.<br/ >
