<em>The TOP New Zealand based MMA media platform!</em><br />
Step into the electrifying world of MMA with a podcast that packs a punch â€“ since its inception in 2023, this dynamic show has been a powerhouse of adrenaline-fueled discussions and riveting insights into the world of mixed martial arts.<br />
<br />
When the time came to brand this thrilling podcast, I was tasked with capturing the intensity and excitement that defines each episode. Drawing inspiration from the head-to-head nature of the show, I envisioned a logo and social media graphics that would embody the raw energy of the octagon.<br />
<br />
As the logo adorns social media platforms, it beckons fans and enthusiasts alike to join in the conversation and immerse themselves in the exhilarating world of combat sports. Welcome to a podcast where passion meets prowess, and where every episode is a ringside seat to the ultimate showdown.<br />
